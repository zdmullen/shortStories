If he was going to go back through the last two days, he would have to stone birds while he was at it. Repeating the exact same change of events and places was not necessarily going to help him find the receipt, because in part he was likely to get the order wrong, and also he simply needed more time to consider where he could have left it exactly. Anywhere he had opened his backpack or taken off his coat was a target. That made the coffee company, real estate development firm, ministry of commerce, and the school locations based on work, and two grocery stores, one pizza stand, and the main train station as potential places. There were also the innumerable metro cars and buses he had been on during the day, but to his mind he had not opened his backpack in any of them. 
Going back to the area where the coffee company was would allow for him to stop by the Italian market where he often bought bread or coffee for his fiancee. He was not sure if carbohydrates or caffeine would help his situation, but he could at least get something that he could always have later. He could also stop and visit a friend in the area if he went at the right time. A funky market comprised of food and craft stands situated in old containers had put up shop in the large brown area near the railroad tracks in that area and would be a good place to get a drink and catch up. 
A palace building was rather appropriately where the real estate development firm had its offices, appropriate in the sense that the lords of real estate holed up in what was once the premier location on Wenceslas Square in the center of the city.
