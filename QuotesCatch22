The following are some important quotes from Joseph Heller's novel:
"Since the holes were in no great demand, he could dig them and fill them up at a leisurely pace, and he was seldom overworked." (115)
"'Be furious you're going to die'...'And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways...There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about--a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatalogical mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?'"
