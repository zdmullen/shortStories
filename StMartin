No one knew whether he was going to show up, whether the geese--any geese--would do their job and alert the town to his whereabouts. Every year something invariably came up, but this year was one in which there simply could not be a search, a town-wide scavenging for the missing St. Martin.
Tables lined the cloister, each representing one of the local companies and their wares. Neon colors were among the new attributes to the branding this year, and they clashed violently with the stained grey and brown white walls of the hall. 
There was already one group of old ladies who stood by the door, albeit reluctantly. Just around the corner on the wall there was a poster collage with photos of the folks currently enjoying treatment in the charity rehabilitation center run in half of the monastery. 
The old ladies did not really wish to be that close to the friends that they had lost in the previous year.
